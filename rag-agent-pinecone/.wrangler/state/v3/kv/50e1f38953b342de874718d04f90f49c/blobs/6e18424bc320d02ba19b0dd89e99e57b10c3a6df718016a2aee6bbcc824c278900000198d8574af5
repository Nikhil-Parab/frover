{"id":"react_tutorial","content":"React hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. The most common hook is useState, which allows you to add state to functional components. To use useState, you first import it from React, then call it inside your component with an initial value. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it. For example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0). You can then use setCount to update the state. Another important hook is useEffect, which lets you perform side effects like API calls or DOM manipulation.","metadata":{"userId":"dev_user","conversationId":"react_lesson","timestamp":1692900000,"type":"tutorial"}}
